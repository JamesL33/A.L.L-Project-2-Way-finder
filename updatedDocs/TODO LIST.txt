- Add pictures from http://www.coventry.ac.uk/life-on-campus/the-university/our-buildings/buildings/ to the sidebarImages folder
    - DO NOT grab the images from that page, the resolution is crap, so images will have to be gathered and cropped down to the correct determined size

- Finish messing around with text size and padding on the integratedPage html page. 
    - Ensure the text looks good on a tablet or add auto fitting ratios instead of using 'em'.

- index is the default page used for previously displaying the sidebar - only use if you're struggling with finding what you need
- index(2) is the default page for the google map made by James

- Add more/different coloured markers for each building location - Make them clickable(?)

- Add generic background info text for each building in the sidebar of the integratedPage html page.
